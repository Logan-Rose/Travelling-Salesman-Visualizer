The Travelling Salesman is a famous problem in combinatorial optimization. Solutions to this problem seek to find the shortest path needed to visit all nodes on a graph. Currently, there are no feasable algorithms that can find an optimal path in a reasonable running time, however there are various algorithms devised to get very close to optimal. This program visualizes the different paths generated by these algorithms.
