The Travelling Salesman is a famous problem in combinatorial optimization. Solutions to this problem seek to find the shortest path needed to visit all nodes on a graph. Currently, there are no feasable algorithms that can find an optimal path in a reasonable running time, however there are various algorithms devised to get very close to optimal. This program visualizes the different paths generated by these algorithms.

Below are some screenshots from this program!

The program also includes a control panel, where yo can select an algorithm, generate a random grid of a specified size, or upload an image (perhaps of a map) on the background
